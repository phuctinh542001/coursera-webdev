          <h3>Banh Xeo</h3>
          <p>Banh xeo is a popular cake in Asian countries, especially Vietnam, Japan, Korea… 
            Although made from rice, each country has its own way of making banh xeo, its own shape 
            and way of enjoying it. In Hue, this dish is often called banh Khoai and is often served with 
            grilled meat, a dipping sauce consisting of soy sauce, liver, and peanuts. In the South of Vietnam, 
            cakes are added with eggs and people eat pancakes with sweet and sour fish sauce. 
            In the North of Vietnam, the filling of banh xeo, in addition to the same ingredients as 
            other places, also adds thinly sliced ​​​​beans or shredded taro. The vegetables served with pancakes 
            are very diverse including lettuce, broccoli, lettuce, perilla, basil, cinnamon leaves, young cold 
            rice leaves... In Can Tho, there are more leaves, in Dong Thap more. Lang leaves, in Vinh Long there 
            are more young mango leaves, in Bac Lieu there are more leaves. The most sophisticated is in the central 
            regions of Vietnam, in addition to raw vegetables, there are also acrid figs, sour star fruit.. 
            Therefore, gourmets are confused as if this dish really originated from Hue. Banh Xeo Phan Thiet is 
            different from banh xeo in other places because it is small in size and is not rolled with 
            lettuce, but placed in a bowl of cooked fish sauce (fish sauce has been pounded with garlic 
            and chili). On Tuyen Quang street, there are many delicious banh xeo shops, so it is also called 
            "banh xeo street". </p>

          <h3>Pho</h3>
          <p>Pho is a traditional dish of Vietnam, originating from Hanoi and Nam Dinh, and is considered 
            one of the typical dishes for Vietnamese cuisine. The main ingredients of pho are rice noodle soup 
            and broth (or broth as it is called in the South) along with thinly sliced ​​beef or chicken. 
            In addition, there are also spices such as: soy sauce, pepper, lemon, fish sauce, chili ... 
            These spices are added depending on the taste of the user. Pho is usually used to make breakfast 
            in the morning or dinner at night; but in big cities, this dish can be enjoyed all day. 
            In the southern provinces of Vietnam and some other regions, pho is presented with a plate of 
            herbs such as onions, bean sprouts and the leaves of coriander and basil, in which coriander is 
            the typical leaf of pho; However, in Hanoi normally there will not be this plate of raw vegetables. 
            Pho is usually beef pho or chicken noodle soup, but sometimes there are other variations such as pho 
            with wine sauce, mixed pho, fried pho, etc. The broth for pho is usually a clear broth that is 
            simmered from beef bones (or pork bones), accompanied by a variety of spices including cinnamon, 
            anise, grilled ginger, cardamom, sage, cloves, coriander seeds, and dried onions. Grilled... The meat 
            used for pho is beef (with all kinds of corn, encrusted, raisin or fully cooked) or chicken (boiled 
            old chicken, torn meat for rich sweet meat). "Banh Pho" is traditionally made from rice flour, 
            coated in thin sheets and then cut into fibers. Pho is always enjoyed while still hot. Accordingly, 
            to have a delicious and flavorful bowl of pho, this also depends a lot on the skill of the cook, the 
            most important of which is the pot of broth.</p>
